      <p>Today, we collectively came up with a definition for a robot and later learned about the basic components that make up a </p>
      <p>Our first task was to try to get the LED lightbulb to light up. To do this, we had to make sure to use less than 5 volts of power in order to prevent the bulb from burning out. We connected a jumper wire from the power source, at 3.3 Volts, to the breadboard. We then connected a resistor to the power source and connected the LED bulb to the resistor. We then connected a jumper wire from the LED bulb to the ground.</p>

      <p>I like to paint and travel.</p>
      <p>I have a passion for art and love to constantly experiment with different mediums. My favorite medium to work with is oil paint. I have been oil painting for over 10 years.</p>

      <p>Learning more about the various kinds of robots today allowed me to analyze the beneficial and the negative impacts of different robots. Every robot is built with a purpose, but can often times be used in negative ways that deviate from the creator's intentions. I'm excited to see the level of simplification that robots can provide in our lives, but am also nervous about the invasion of personal safety that comes with more robot influence.</p>
      <p>Working in groups allowed us to help each other with understanding the concepts more clearly. But I think that it would be more beneficial to work in slightly smaller groups so that every person is given the chance or is able to spend more hands on time while experimenting with the robot. </p>

      <p>We wrote C++ code which would allow the LED lights to blink to the rythm of Lady Gaga's "Bad Romance. (FINISH THIS QUESTION LATER)"</p>
      <p>Both Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard's work is similar in that both comprise of creations that are dedicated towards simplifying daily tasks for humans. Howard programmed a robot to help children with limited mobility to be able to play games on a tablet. Veloso created the CoBot, which is a robot that acts as an office aid that performs tasks by scoping out its surroundings. </p> 
      <p>Our team worked together well. We all split up the tasks efficiently and worked together to solve problems that we encountered on the way.</p>
      <p>Every Arduino sketch should comprise of a set up function and a loop function. The set up function is where you can create integers, arrays, or other variable, while the loop function executes a few lines of code repeatedly. </p> 
      <p>Reflection 7/13/17</p>
      <p>I learned that it was necessary to connect a jumper wire to ground and one to the power source. Finish question: What have you learned about circuits that you did not know before?</p>
      <p>My favorite part of out robot's dance was the finale of the Indiana Jones theme song. Our robot spins around in place when the music reaches the climax.</p>
      <p>Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard probably need sound, touch, and display for their outputs.</p>
      <p>Reflection 7/14/17</p>
      <p>Today, we learned how to use whisker wires to allow the robot to navigate through a maze with obstacles. In order to use whisker wires, it is necessary to use a 3-pin header and two resistors per whisker wire: one that connects to the power and one that connects to a pin on the digital side. Even though we had some hardware issues with our robot, we were able to write the basic code needed for the robot to turn when the whisker wires detect obstacles.</p>

      <p>A list allows you to type a sequence of strings or variables, which are then given a unique index. It is helpful to use lists to store a sequence of variables and change them as needed. You can add another item in the list by using the append() funtion, you can order the items in the list, etc.</p>
      <p>I think that the partnership with Samiksha worked the best because we were having fun while trying to solve the problems that we encountered. We built off of each other's knowledge to achieve the end result.</p>
      <p>Reflection 7/18/17</p>
      <p>I learned that information in the cloud is stored in several servers.</p>
      <p>I think that LaTex is a markup language because it is used to change the format of documents, rather used to give instructions to the computer.</p>
      <p>Reflection 7/19/17</p>
      <p>I would like to add pictures of my paintings with the inspiration behind them, and maybe put pictures of a new painting in progress.</p>
      <p>I would like to know more about the different components of a MVC paradigm and how they relate to each other.</p>
      <p>Reflection 7/24/17</p>
      <p>The internet has stored information about your name, birthday, zip code, and other information based on what you have given to different websites.</p>
      <p>A programmer can secure his or her website by encrypting the website. The programmer can also refrain from asking too much personal information or allow the user to set up a secure password by checking what they have inputted.</p>
      <p>Latanya Sweeney is known for her work on the theory of k-anonymity, which helps anonymize user personal data.</p>
      <p>I enjoyed working on the python projects the most this summer. I would try to extend the password dictionary attack project to add more ways to prevent creating a bad password, or create a function which creates a unique, and safe password for the user. I would like to learn more about AI and robotics.</p>
      <p>Reflection 7/26/17</p>
      <p>Python dictionaries help allow an element to be attributed to another unique elements or definition. For example, a python dictionary can state the names of students in a classroom and assign a their ages. Ex. students = {"Bob" : 17, "Hannah": 16, "Joe": 18}</p>
      <p>Data science is pretty interesting as there are numerous ways of storing, analyzing, and using different sets of data.</p>
      <p>It is interesting that algorithms carry out specific intsructions and can work in any case.</p>
      <p>Algorithms can help sort the data that we use on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>Reflection 7/27/17</p>
      <p>Using objects makes the project easier because the user can read the code easily and you can reuse the objects multiple times, instead of rewriting blocks of code.</p>
      <p>I was proud that I was able to use a dictionary to store the connections. I wasn't sure how to make the connections portion of the program work, and experimented with dictionaries. I need to learn to use methods while appending items into the dictionaries though.</p>
      <p>Reflection 7/28/17</p>
      <p>I'm most proud of figuring out how to effectively use methods and classes in order to make the code more easy to read and navigate through.</p>
      <p>I'm most excited for the back end part of the final project, including being able to use python and other languages to write the code for the website's functionality. At the moment, the back end part of programming interests me more than the front end part, including the styling.</p>
      <p>Reflection 7/31/17</p>
      <p>One skill I could build is to be more confident when articulating my ideas.</p>
      <p>finish</p>

      <p>Our team is diving up the work pretty well. Today, JuHye was able to create the HTML backbone for the homepage of our website. I was able to go through the djangogirls tutorial to create a new website, while Anna was then able to pull this from GitHub and create an events page.</p>
      <p>I was responsible for creating the skeleton of the website today. Later, I will need to work on the backend of the website using python. We tried to list the tasks in order of priority and we are trying our best to stick to that order while completing the tasks.</p>
