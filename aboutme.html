            <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I like to paint and travel.</p>
      <p>I have a passion for art and love to constantly experiment with different mediums. My favorite medium to work with is oil paint. I have been oil painting for over 10 years.</p>
      <p>7/10/17 Robot/Circuit Introduction</p>
      <p>Today, we collectively came up with a definition for a robot and later learned about the basic components that make up a </p>
      <p>Our first task was to try to get the LED lightbulb to light up. To do this, we had to make sure to use less than 5 volts of power in order to prevent the bulb from burning out. We connected a jumper wire from the power source, at 3.3 Volts, to the breadboard. We then connected a resistor to the power source and connected the LED bulb to the resistor. We then connected a jumper wire from the LED bulb to the ground.</p>

      <p>Learning more about the various kinds of robots today allowed me to analyze the beneficial and the negative impacts of different robots. Every robot is built with a purpose, but can often times be used in negative ways that deviate from the creator's intentions. I'm excited to see the level of simplification that robots can provide in our lives, but am also nervous about the invasion of personal safety that comes with more robot influence.</p>
      <p>Working in groups allowed us to help each other with understanding the concepts more clearly. But I think that it would be more beneficial to work in slightly smaller groups so that every person is given the chance or is able to spend more hands on time while experimenting with the robot. </p>
