            <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>I like to paint and travel.</p>
      <p>I have a passion for art and love to constantly experiment with different mediums. My favorite medium to work with is oil paint. I have been oil painting for over 10 years.</p>
      <h2>7/10/17 Robot/Circuit Introduction</h2>
      <p>Today, we collectively came up with a definition for a robot and later learned about the basic components that make up a </p>
      <p>Our first task was to try to get the LED lightbulb to light up. To do this, we had to make sure to use less than 5 volts of power in order to prevent the bulb from burning out. We connected a jumper wire from the power source, at 3.3 Volts, to the breadboard. We then connected a resistor to the power source and connected the LED bulb to the resistor. We then connected a jumper wire from the LED bulb to the ground.</p>

      <p>Learning more about the various kinds of robots today allowed me to analyze the beneficial and the negative impacts of different robots. Every robot is built with a purpose, but can often times be used in negative ways that deviate from the creator's intentions. I'm excited to see the level of simplification that robots can provide in our lives, but am also nervous about the invasion of personal safety that comes with more robot influence.</p>
      <p>Working in groups allowed us to help each other with understanding the concepts more clearly. But I think that it would be more beneficial to work in slightly smaller groups so that every person is given the chance or is able to spend more hands on time while experimenting with the robot. </p>

      <p>We wrote C++ code which would allow the LED lights to blink to the rythm of Lady Gaga's "Bad Romance. (FINISH THIS QUESTION LATER)"</p>
      <p>Both Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard's work is similar in that both comprise of creations that are dedicated towards simplifying daily tasks for humans. Howard programmed a robot to help children with limited mobility to be able to play games on a tablet. Veloso created the CoBot, which is a robot that acts as an office aid that performs tasks by scoping out its surroundings. </p> 
      <p>Our team worked together well. We all split up the tasks efficiently and worked together to solve problems that we encountered on the way.</p>
      <p>Every Arduino sketch should comprise of a set up function and a loop function. The set up function is where you can create integers, arrays, or other variable, while the loop function executes a few lines of code repeatedly. </p> 
      <p>Reflection 7/13/17</p>
      <p>I learned that it was necessary to connect a jumper wire to ground and one to the power source. Finish question: What have you learned about circuits that you did not know before?</p>
      <p>My favorite part of out robot's dance was the finale of the Indiana Jones theme song. Our robot spins around in place when the music reaches the climax.</p>
      <p>Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard probably need sound, touch, and display for their outputs.</p>
      <p>Reflection 7/14/17</p>
      <p>Today, we learned how to use whisker wires to allow the robot to navigate through a maze with obstacles. In order to use whisker wires, it is necessary to use a 3-pin header and two resistors per whisker wire: one that connects to the power and one that connects to a pin on the digital side. Even though we had some hardware issues with our robot, we were able to write the basic code needed for the robot to turn when the whisker wires detect obstacles.</p>

      <p>A list allows you to type a sequence of strings or variables, which are then given a unique index. It is helpful to use lists to store a sequence of variables and change them as needed. You can add another item in the list by using the append() funtion, you can order the items in the list, etc.</p>
      <p>I think that the partnership with Samiksha worked the best because we were having fun while trying to solve the problems that we encountered. We built off of each other's knowledge to achieve the end result.</p>
